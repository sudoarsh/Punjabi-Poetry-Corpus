Punjabi Poetry Corpus
This repository contains a collection of Punjabi poetry gathered from http://punjabi-kavita.com.  It's a useful starting point if you need a  Punjabi text dataset for various language-related projects.

Contents

poetry_corpus.zip: A zipped CSV file containing the compiled Punjabi poems. Due to its size, the CSV is provided in a zipped format.
grim_reader.py: A Python script for reading a list of URLs from which the poetry was originally gathered.
Note: The original program used to generate the complete URL list is lost.
